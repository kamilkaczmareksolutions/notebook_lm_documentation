## What's new
Today, we're introducing Audio Overview, a new way to turn your documents into engaging audio discussions. With one click, two AI hosts start up a lively “deep dive” discussion based on your sources. They summarize your material, make connections between topics, and banter back and forth. You can even download the conversation and take it on the go.

To try it out, follow these steps:

* Go to NotebookLM.
* Create a new notebook.
* Add at least one source.
* In your Notebook guide, click on the “Generate” button to create an Audio Overview.
Learn more about the feature here!


### Sept 26 2024
# Sept 26 2024
## What's new
New Source Types: Since launching, we’ve continued to add support for a wide range of source materials using the multimodal capabilities in Gemini. Today, you can now add public YouTube URLs and audio files directly into your notebook, alongside PDFs, Google Docs, Slides, websites and more. See more details on source types supported and limitations in this article.

A faster way to share Audio Overviews: Two weeks ago, we made it possible to create an Audio Overview with one tap. Today, we’re making it possible to share that Audio Overview directly. When you tap “share,” it generates a public link that you can easily share with others. At this time, Workspace accounts cannot use this feature to share Audio Overviews publicly.


### Oct 17 2024
# Oct 17 2024
## What's new
We’ve been delighted with the reception of Audio Overviews so far, and we’re introducing a pair of new features today:

* Guide the conversation: Now you can provide instructions before you generate a "Deep Dive" Audio Overview. For example, you can focus on specific topics or adjust the expertise level to suit your audience. Think of it like slipping the AI hosts a quick note right before they go on the air, which will change how they cover your material.
* Background listening: You can also listen to Audio Overviews while continuing to work within NotebookLM. Query your sources, get citations, and explore relevant quotes without interrupting the audio.
We’re also announcing NotebookLM Business, an upcoming version that will be offered via Google Workspace with enhanced features for businesses, universities and organizations. From the start, NotebookLM has made data privacy and security a top priority, and we’ll continue to do that.

## Features

### Sources
# Sources
A source is a static copy of the source document you import or upload to the app. When using NotebookLM, the model will use the sources you upload to answer your questions or complete your requests. You can see the full list of supported source types in the below section.

NotebookLM can’t delete or edit your original files. When you upload a Google Doc or a local PDF file from your computer, the app makes a copy of the original file. NotebookLM doesn’t keep track of changes to the original doc automatically, including access to it, so you have to manually refresh any local file you uploaded or use the Click to Sync button to refresh imported Google Docs and Slides in the source viewer.

## Source Overview
When you upload a new source to NotebookLM, the app instantly creates a source overview that summarizes the document and offers key topics and questions to ask. Think of it as a research assistant that helps you better understand the source material.

## Source Types and Limitations
* Google Docs
* Google Slides
* PDF, Text and Markdown files
* Web URLs
* Copy-pasted text
* Youtube URLs of public videos
* Audio files
* Each source can contain up to 500,000 words, or up to 200MB for uploaded files. Each notebook can contain up to 50 sources. We’ll review these limits periodically to help determine the best user experiences
* Avoid uploading documents you don’t have the applicable rights to
Importing via Google Drive

* NotebookLM can’t delete or edit your original files in Drive. When you import Google Doc or Google Slides, the app makes a copy of the original file.

### Notebooks
# Notebooks
Notebooks are the way you organize projects in NotebookLM. They are similar to how folders organize the files on your computer. Each notebook is totally separate, so NotebookLM can’t access information from multiple notebooks at the same time.

## Sharing notebooks
You can share notebooks by opening a notebook and clicking the Share icon in the top-right corner of the screen. You can grant either Viewer or Editor access to another user by adding their email address.

* A viewer will have read-only access to all the source documents and notes you shared with them in the shared notebook
* An editor will be able to view, add, or remove sources and notes in your shared notebook as well as share it further with other users
Personal gmail accounts can share a notebook with up to 50 other individual users, but can't share with Google Groups.

Enterprise or EDU accounts (e.g. email@mycompany.com or email@uni.edu) can share a notebook with an unlimited number of individual users and google groups within the same organization.

## Notebook Guide
When you open a notebook with sources loaded, the app instantly generates a Notebook Guide that summarizes all source documents automatically, and give you a big-picture view of the entire notebook, with quick links to generate FAQ, Briefing Doc, Table of Contents, and Timeline based on all content in the Notebook.

### Audio Overview
Audio Overviews are lively “deep dive” discussions between two AI hosts who summarize key topics in your sources. Note that Audio Overviews are not meant to be a subjective view of a topic of the AI hosts, but simply a reflection of the source content that you have uploaded.

## Notebook Limitations
  * You are limited to 100 notebooks

### Asking questions
# Asking questions
Once you have uploaded your sources, you can ask the model questions about your source material or give the model instructions to perform actions.

You can use the checkbox on each source to include or exclude certain sources the model should use to answer your question in a notebook.

## Citations
For most questions or instructions you give NotebookLM, the response will include one or multiple citations, a specific block of text (and/or images) from your source that is considered relevant to the question and was used by NotebookLM to build the response for you.

Citations are direct quotes, and seeing these passages can help you check the accuracy of the response and find the original quote. You can hover over a citation to see the complete text quoted. You can also click on any one citation to have the source viewer auto-scroll to the location of the quoted text in the sources.

A key feature of NotebookLM is that chat responses only use data from your sources, unless you explicitly ask the model to do something more creative (e.g. “rewrite the ending of my short story”). For this reason, you may receive the chat response “NotebookLM can’t answer this question. Try rephrasing it, or ask a different question.”

## Suggested Actions
NotebookLM dynamically suggests actions based on what you selected.

* When you select a passage while reading a source, NotebookLM automatically offers to summarize the text in a new note, or help you understand technical language or complicated ideas
* While you’re writing a note, NotebookLM offers tools to polish or refine your prose, or suggest related ideas from your sources based on what you’ve just written
* When you select one or more notes, NotebookLM offers to combine your notes or create an outline based on the selected notes

### Notes
# Notes
You can create up to 1,000 notes per notebook. All your notes are organized on the noteboard.

* You can save a useful response to a new note by clicking the Pin icon in the upper-right corner of the response. Notes created from saved responses can’t be edited once they are created.
* You can type your own text within a note by clicking Add note in the upper-right corner of the noteboard
* You also can copy and paste responses or passages from your sources into a new note
* You can also click on a suggested action such as Create an outline when you have one or more existing notes in focus, and NotebookLM will then save the output directly into a new note for you.

## Troubleshooting

### Frequently Asked Questions
# Frequently Asked Questions
## General Information
### What are the available regions for NotebookLM?
NotebookLM is available to all users (18+) in the 180+ regions where the Gemini API is available.

### Should I access NotebookLM on my desktop computer or my mobile device?
While mobile is supported, at this time, NotebookLM is best viewed on a desktop computer.

### I can't access NotebookLM. What could be the reason?
Common reasons include:

* Your country may not be supported (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/available-regions).
* You might be using a school or work-managed account (e.g. x@y.edu), and your organization’s admin needs to enable access to the NotebookLM app.
* Only 18+ users are permitted to use the app. Make sure you have verify your age for the google account before accessing NotebookLM. To verify age, simply follow the steps here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085
### How do I report offensive responses generated in NotebookLM?
If you think a response generated in NotebookLM is offensive or unsafe, let us know by clicking on the thumbs down button and choose the Offensive/unsafe as the reason. We will review the report and take appropriate actions to improve the safety of our model.

### How do I report a shared Notebook for infringing my rights?
If you see content in a shared Notebook that you believe violates the law or your rights, let us know by clicking Report Notebook, which can be found in the three-dot menu for that Notebook on the homepage or via this direct link. We will review the material and consider blocking, limiting, or removing access to it.

### What about the privacy of my data in NotebookLM?
NotebookLM will never train on any of your data. Please read more here.

### Which Gemini version does NotebookLM run on?
As of July 2024, Gemini 1.5. We will continue to experiment on which model works best (and hopefully fastest) to serve our users so this may change over time

## Features and Capabilities
### Will updates to the Google Doc or Slides be reflected in NotebookLM?
When you import a Google Doc or Slides into NotebookLM, we make a copy of the original Google Doc in NotebookLM at the moment of upload. Past this point, the app doesn’t keep track of changes to the file automatically, including access to it. NotebookLM can’t delete or edit your original files. You have to manually re-upload any local file, or use the Click to Sync with Drive button to refresh imported Google Docs and Slides in the source viewer.

### What is the maximum file size limit for sources in NotebookLM?
The current limit is 500,000 words per source or up to 200MB for local uploads. There is no page limit.

### What languages does NotebookLM support?
NotebookLM currently supports over 100+ languages. You can change your language preference in your Google Account settings.

### Does NotebookLM support PDFs?
Yes, NotebookLM supports PDFs. However, there are some limitations:

* PDF upload via Drive is not yet supported. Please upload PDFs from your computer.
* Starting September 2024, image-only PDFs will be supported. While NotebookLM is improving its handling of images in PDFs, you may need to re-upload previously imported PDFs as functionality improves.
### Do you have any tips on how I should get NotebookLM to summarize a source?
NotebookLM offers two modes for summarizing sources: you may ask for a summary of specific topics from your source directly in the chat, or you can find an auto-generated summary of the entire source in the Source Guide by clicking to open a source in the left hand side source viewer. When you ask for summaries in the chat for more specific summaries, try these tips:

* Ask specific questions about the information you're looking for. If you have multiple sources selected, try including source names in your query to help NotebookLM narrow down the search. For example, instead of "Summarize this source," try "Summarize key findings about dog training from the source document titled Dog Training 101."
### Can I work on a note collaboratively with others in real-time?
Yes! Note edits are reflected in real-time for all collaborators. If you have the same notebook open, any changes made by one person will appear for everyone else who has the notebook open. Only users being added as an “editor” to a shared Notebook can edit notes.

### Why does NotebookLM sometimes say it can’t answer my question?
There are a few reasons why NotebookLM might not be able to answer your question:

* Safety Flags: The content of your source might contain language that triggers a safety flag. This can occur with sensitive topics like violence, sexuality, or obscenity, even in historical contexts.
* Unclear Phrasing: Try rephrasing your question to be clearer or more specific. When your notebook contains a large set of sources (that exceeds the LLM’s context window size), NotebookLM needs to first retrieve the most relevant information based on your question then try to build a response using this information. A more specific question will help NotebookLM locate these relevant bits of information.
* Information Not in Sources: NotebookLM is designed to answer questions based on the information provided in your uploaded sources. If the answer isn't in the source material, it won't be able to provide a response.
### When I import a source via URL, how does NotebookLM handle HTML sources with interactive elements?
Only the visible text on the page is imported. Improvements to this import type are underway.

### How are sources, chat context, and notes used in responding to prompts?
* Notes: Only used when specifically selected
* Sources: Always used, either the entire set or the subset you've selected.
* Conversation History: Also utilized in generating responses.
### Is there a dark theme?
Yes, you can switch between light/dark/auto mode using the sun icon in the top right corner.

## Troubleshooting
### My source import failed, why?
If the source length exceeds the allowed word limit (500,000 words per source) or over the file size allowed (200MB), or if your original PDF file is copy-protected, NotebookLM won't be able to import those sources.

### Why can't I access NotebookLM on my company or edu email address?
NotebookLM is currently available to personal Google accounts and participating enterprise Google Workspace or Google Workspace for Education users.

If you are using a company or edu email address and unable to access the app, please review this help center article and work with your workspace Admin to enable the NotebookLM app for your organization.

### Why does my document look different in NotebookLM?
